There are a couple of ways we can start with Hasura,the first and the easiest one was the Hasura cloud. Hasura cloud starts with a generous free tier which helps to set up the foundation and test your application.

In one of our latest product release updates, it is noted that the Hasura plugin will be available in the Vercel Integrations. This update can significantly couple both the frontend and backend development. Especially for webapps that are based on NextJS.

## NextJS and Hasura

The main advantage of using Hasura along with the NextJS is for faster and production-grade frontend and backend development. Similar to how NextJS is considered as the production-ready Frontend development tool, Hasura can be considered as the production-ready backend development tool.

### NextJS Setup

```
mkdir hasura-nextjs
cd hasura-nextjs
npx create-next-app@latest .
yarn dev
```
